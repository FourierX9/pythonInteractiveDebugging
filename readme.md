# Use Interactive Debugging In Pycharm

How To Use:

First, launch main.py in the debug mode and add a breakpoint after Line: a=1. After pycharm has stopped, selct the 
code you want to run in debug.py(for me it is all of the code). Then right click and choose Execute Selection in Python
Console(Alt+Shift+E) and you will be able to debug interactively.

Python是解释性语言，和Java不同，所以能支持这种调试方式。
